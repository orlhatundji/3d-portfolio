      Simon is an exceptional Software Engineer. 
      Having collaborated with him on multiple software development projects, 
      I’ve consistently been impressed by his strong expertise in 
      both frontend and backend development of large scale systems. 
      This, combined with his resourcefulness, excellent teamwork
